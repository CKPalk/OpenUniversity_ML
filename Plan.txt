Distribution of dataset through box-whisker
Show mapped points
 - we taked these mapped points and build a kde
Distribution of dataset over the city through kde
Using the distribution and time I tried to K-NN classify
Poor results as it's difficult to predict crime
Show the relation between data and time through drill-downs:
 - Data to year
 - Data to month
 - Data to week
 - Data to day
 - Data to hour
Show relation between time of year and crime rate ( less in winter, more in summer )
 - Quotes or sources to explain why
Show temperature vs crime
 ! hopefully this will help in our conclusion
